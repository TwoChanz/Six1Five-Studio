# Website Logo Integration Prompt for SixlFive Studio

## Primary Logo Placement Instructions

**Header/Navigation:**
- Place the main SixlFive Studio logo (circular drone-inspired design with three stars) in the top-left corner of all pages
- Size: 40-50px height for desktop, 35px for mobile
- Ensure logo links back to homepage

**Footer:**
- Include logo in footer alongside company information
- Size: 60-80px height
- Position: Left side of footer, above company description
- Add subtle glow effect matching the blue accent color

**Favicon:**
- Create 16x16, 32x32, and 180x180px versions of the circular logo element
- Use the navy blue center circle with the three white stars
- Ensure visibility at small sizes

## Secondary Logo Applications

**Loading Screens:**
- Use animated version of logo while 3D models are loading
- Subtle rotation animation of the outer drone propellers
- Center of screen, 120-150px size

**Watermarks on 3D Models:**
- Semi-transparent logo overlay (20% opacity)
- Bottom-right corner of 3D viewer windows
- Size: 80-100px
- Use white version on dark backgrounds, navy on light backgrounds

**Social Media Integration:**
- Include logo in Open Graph meta tags for social sharing
- Size: 1200x630px for social preview cards
- Logo positioned in bottom-right corner of preview images

**Print Materials/PDFs:**
- Header of project reports and documentation
- Business card integration
- Letterhead design

## Brand Consistency Guidelines

**Color Variations:**
- Primary: Full color version (blue gradient + navy center)
- Secondary: Navy monochrome version for single-color applications
- Reverse: White version for dark backgrounds
- Accent: Use the blue gradient (#00A2E8 to #0066CC) for highlights

**Sizing Standards:**
- Minimum size: 24px height (maintain legibility of stars)
- Maximum size: 300px height (for hero sections)
- Always maintain aspect ratio
- Ensure clear space of 1/2 logo width around all sides

**File Format Requirements:**
- SVG for web applications (scalable, crisp at all sizes)
- PNG with transparent background for overlays
- JPG for social media and print applications
- ICO format for favicons

## Implementation Code Snippets

**CSS for Responsive Logo:**
```css
.logo {
  height: 45px;
  width: auto;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .logo {
    height: 35px;
  }
}

.logo:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05);
}
```

**HTML Structure:**
```html
<a href="/" class="logo-link">
  <img src="/logo.svg" alt="SixlFive Studio - Reality Capture Specialists" class="logo">
</a>
```

## Special Considerations

**3D Model Viewers:**
- Ensure logo doesn't interfere with model interaction
- Use fade-in/fade-out on hover for better UX
- Position outside of measurement tool areas

**Dark Mode Compatibility:**
- Provide white/light versions for dark theme
- Test contrast ratios for accessibility compliance
- Maintain brand recognition across all themes

**Performance:**
- Optimize SVG files (remove unnecessary code)
- Use appropriate image compression for raster formats
- Implement lazy loading for decorative logo instances

**Accessibility:**
- Include descriptive alt text: "SixlFive Studio - Reality Capture Specialists"
- Ensure sufficient contrast ratios
- Make logo links keyboard accessible

This comprehensive integration will establish strong brand presence while maintaining professional aesthetics across all touchpoints of your website.
